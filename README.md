How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

The biggest factor in writing maintainable and readable code are providing frequent comments that describe the intended functionality, the purpose of each class, variable, and function, and separate out each section of the code. This module could be used in the future as an interactive database for any type of .csv file, making user interactions with the database much easier and more user-friendly.


How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist, I apply a rigorous and logical approach to solving problems. This must be accompanied by an understanding of how the end user will interact with any software that I create, and I need to keep that in mind.


What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists apply mathematical logic and algorithm-centric approaches to solving problems. When a company or individual has a problem that can be solved with logic, software is the answer.
